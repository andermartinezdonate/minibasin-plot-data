# minibasin-plot-data

A few months ago some former colleagues and myself have published a paper on the stratigraphic evolution of minibasins that are present on many continental slopes (Sylvester, Z., Cantelli, A., and Pirmez, C., 2015, [Stratigraphic evolution of intraslope minibasins: Insights from surface-based model](http://archives.datapages.com/data/bulletns/2015/06jun/BLTN14082/BLTN14082.html): AAPG Bulletin, v. 99, no. 6, p. 1099â€“1129, doi: 10.1306/01081514082.) This repository contains surface (line) data needed for recreating the stratigraphic model cross sections 

We used a simple model that investigates the interplay between subsidence and sedimentation and helps in the understanding of how stratal termination patterns relate to variations in sediment input and basin subsidence. Conventional sequence stratigraphy focuses on what is happening on the shelf and the shelf edge; and the origin of stratal patterns that characterize <a href="http://www.sepmstrata.org/page.aspx?&pageid=15&3">typical 'slug diagram'</a> are not trivial to relate to the three main parameters that influence continental-margin startigraphy: changes in sea level, sediment supply, and subsidence. Our minibasin model is simpler because (1) it only has two parameters: sediment supply and subsidence (the impact of sea level - if any - is included in the sediment supply curve); and (2) sedimentary layers are deposited horizontally during each time step. The basic idea is to investigate the geometries of a system that consists of a depression that deepens through time and sediment is deposited in it with a certain rate. The figures that follow are interactive versions of the model cross sections that were published in the paper. I have used <a href="https://plot.ly">Plotly</a> to create the interactive plots.

You can check out the cross sections, in an interactive format, with additional explanations, over [here](http://zsylvester.github.io/minibasin-plot-data/).
